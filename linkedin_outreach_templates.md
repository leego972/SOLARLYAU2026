### Message 1: Introduction + Proof
```
Thanks for connecting, {{firstName}}!

I'll keep this brief. SolarlyAU helps Australian solar installers get consistent, exclusive leads without the usual marketplace competition.

Here's what makes us different:

**Real Results:**
- James from Solar Bright (Melbourne): 320% ROI, 60% conversion rate
- Sarah from Sunboost Solar (Gold Coast): $180K revenue in 3 months
- David from Solar Warehouse (Sydney): $15K average deal size, 65% conversion

**How it works:**
1. Homeowners submit detailed solar quotes through our platform
2. We match them with installers in their area
3. You get exclusive access (no sharing with 10 other companies)
4. Pre-qualified leads ready to buy

**Your first lead is FREE** - no credit card, no commitment. Just see the quality for yourself.

Would you be interested in seeing how this could work for {{companyName}}? I can set up your account in 5 minutes.

### Message 2: Case Study Deep Dive
```
Hi {{firstName}},

Following up on my last message about SolarlyAU's lead generation platform.

I wanted to share a specific case study that might resonate with {{companyName}}'s situation:

**Solar Bright (Melbourne) - James Mitchell:**
- **Before:** 2-3 leads per week, 30% conversion
- **After:** 15+ leads per week, 60% conversion
- **Revenue Impact:** $12K average deal × 9 closed deals/month = $108K monthly revenue
- **ROI:** 320% return on lead costs

James said: "SolarlyAU transformed our lead generation. The quality is outstanding - every lead is pre-qualified and ready to buy."

**What makes our leads different:**
- Exclusive to you (not sold to 5 other installers)
- Pre-qualified (budget confirmed, timeline set)
- Detailed (roof type, energy usage, preferred system size)
- Local (matched to your service area)

**Your first lead is FREE.** No risk, just see the quality.

Want me to send you a sample lead from {{city}} so you can see exactly what you'd receive?
```

### Message 3: Urgency + Scarcity
```
{{firstName}},

Quick update: We're limiting to 3 installers per region to maintain lead exclusivity. Currently have 2 spots left in {{city}}/{{region}}.

**Why this matters for {{companyName}}:**
- Once we hit 3 installers in your area, we stop onboarding
- Leads get distributed among active installers only
- First-come, first-served on high-value leads

**Current lead availability in {{city}}:**
- 8 leads this week (avg value: $14K each)
- 23 leads this month
- Average 4-hour response time from homeowners

**Your first lead is still FREE** - but I wanted to give you a heads up about the regional limit before the spots fill.

Interested in claiming your spot? Takes 5 minutes to set up your account.
