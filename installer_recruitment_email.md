## Email Body (Version 2: Pain Point Focus)

**Subject:** Stop Wasting Money on Marketing - Pay Only for Real Solar Leads

Hi [Installer Name],

Are you tired of paying for leads that never convert? Or spending thousands on Google Ads that bring in tire-kickers?

I'm reaching out because we've built something different: **SolarlyAU** - a marketplace where you only pay for leads you actually want, after seeing all the details upfront.

**The problem with traditional lead gen:**

- You pay upfront before knowing if the lead is qualified
- Shared leads go to 5+ competitors
- No transparency on lead quality
- Monthly subscriptions whether you get leads or not

**How SolarlyAU works:**

Our AI system finds real Australian homeowners interested in solar, verifies their contact details, scores their quality (60-95%), and lists them in our marketplace. You browse, choose the leads you want, and pay only for those.

**Every lead includes:**

- Full name, verified phone, verified email
- Property address and postcode
- Estimated system size (kW)
- Current monthly electricity bill
- Property type (residential/commercial)
- Quality score (our AI's confidence rating)
- Time listed (so you know how fresh it is)

**Pricing:**

- $45-$95 per lead (based on quality score)
- First lead FREE for new installers
- No monthly fees, no contracts, no minimums

**Current marketplace:**

- 654 leads available across all major Australian states
- New leads added every 4 hours
- Average lead sells within 4 hours (high demand from installers)
- Residential (5-13kW) and commercial (30-99kW) options

**Try it risk-free:**

Sign up at [https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup](https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup) and claim your first lead free. If it doesn't convert, you haven't lost a cent.

**Subject:** Re: Get Your First Solar Lead FREE - Still interested?

Hi [Installer Name],

I sent you an email a few days ago about SolarlyAU's free first lead offer. I wanted to follow up because:

1. We still have **[X] leads available in [State]** right now
2. The first-lead-free offer is still active (but filling up fast)

I know you're busy running your business, so I'll keep this short:

**What is SolarlyAU?**  
A marketplace where you can browse verified solar leads, see all the details upfront (name, phone, email, property, system size, quality score), and only pay for the ones you want.

**Why it works:**  
No monthly fees, no contracts, no shared leads. You're in control.

**Getting started:**  
2-minute signup → browse leads → claim your free lead → purchase more if you want them.

**Sign up here:** [https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup](https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup)

If you're not interested, no worries - just let me know and I won't follow up again.

Cheers,
