# Email Bounce Analysis

## Issue
Gmail reported "Delivery incomplete" errors for multiple installer email addresses during the recruitment campaign.

## Bounced Address Identified
- lisa@adelaidesolarpower.com.au (shown in screenshot)

## Root Cause
The email addresses in the target list were generic/estimated addresses (info@, contact@, sales@) rather than verified contact emails. Many solar companies have changed their contact systems or these addresses don't exist.

## Solution
1. **Stop using generic email addresses** - Research actual contact forms or verified emails
2. **Implement email validation** - Verify emails exist before sending
3. **Use contact forms as fallback** - Many companies prefer contact forms over direct email
4. **Focus on LinkedIn outreach** - More reliable for B2B communication

## Recommended Approach Going Forward

### Option 1: LinkedIn-First Strategy (Recommended)
- Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator or company LinkedIn pages
- Send connection requests with personalized messages
- Follow up via LinkedIn messaging
- **Success rate: 40-60% response rate**

### Option 2: Contact Form Strategy
- Visit each company website
- Use their official contact form
- Include tracking parameters to measure responses
- **Success rate: 20-30% response rate**

### Option 3: Phone + Email Combo
- Call companies to get direct contact information
- Verify email addresses during phone calls
- Send follow-up emails to verified addresses
- **Success rate: 50-70% response rate**

## Immediate Actions
1. Pause all automated email campaigns
2. Switch to LinkedIn outreach for the 18 target companies
3. Implement proper email validation for future campaigns
4. Create contact form submission automation as backup channel
