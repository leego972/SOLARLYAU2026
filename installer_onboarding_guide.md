## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Complete Your Profile

After signing up, you'll be taken to your installer dashboard. Before you can purchase leads, complete your profile with:

- **Company name** - Your registered business name
- **ABN** - Australian Business Number (for verification)
- **Service areas** - States and postcodes you serve
- **Contact details** - Phone and email for lead notifications
- **Payment method** - Add a credit card for instant lead purchases

**Why this matters:** Your service area determines which leads you'll see in the marketplace. The more specific your postcodes, the better we can match you with relevant leads.

### Step 2: Browse the Marketplace

Once your profile is complete, you'll see the lead marketplace. Each lead card shows:

- **Quality score** (60-95%) - Our AI's confidence rating
- **Customer name** - Full name of the homeowner
- **Location** - Suburb, state, and postcode
- **System size** - Estimated kW capacity they need
- **Monthly bill** - Current electricity spend
- **Property type** - Residential or commercial
- **Verification badges** - Phone verified, email verified
- **Time listed** - How fresh the lead is
- **Price** - What you'll pay for this lead

**Pro tip:** Leads with 85%+ quality scores have the highest conversion rates. Start with these to test the platform.

### Step 3: Claim Your Free Lead

As a new installer, your first lead is completely free. Here's how to claim it:

1. Browse the marketplace and find a lead in your service area
2. Click "Purchase Lead" on any lead card
3. At checkout, enter promo code: **FIRSTFREE**
4. Complete the purchase (you won't be charged)
5. The lead details will appear in your "My Leads" section

**Important:** You can only use the FIRSTFREE code once, so choose a high-quality lead (85%+ score recommended).

### Step 4: Contact the Lead

Once you've purchased a lead, you'll see full contact details:

- Full name
- Phone number (verified)
- Email address (verified)
- Property address
- System size estimate
- Monthly electricity bill
- Any additional notes from the homeowner

**Best practices for first contact:**

1. **Call within 1 hour** - Speed matters. Homeowners are talking to multiple installers.
2. **Reference their details** - "Hi [Name], I saw you're interested in a [X]kW solar system for your property in [Suburb]."
3. **Offer value immediately** - "I can come out for a free site assessment this week. When works for you?"
4. **Follow up by email** - Send a professional email with your company details and next steps.

### Step 5: Track Your Results

After contacting the lead, update its status in your dashboard:

- **Contacted** - You've reached out
- **Quote sent** - You've provided a quote
- **Won** - You've closed the deal
- **Lost** - They went with another installer

**Why this matters:** Tracking your conversion rate helps you understand which lead types work best for your business. It also helps us improve our AI scoring.

## Understanding Lead Quality Scores

Our AI scores every lead from 60% to 95% based on multiple factors:

### High Quality (85-95%)

- Strong buying signals (requested quotes from multiple sources)
- Verified contact details (phone and email confirmed)
- Property ownership verified
- Realistic system size for their property
- Electricity bill supports solar ROI
- Recent inquiry (within 48 hours)

**Expected conversion rate:** 30-50%  
**Average price:** $75-$95

### Medium Quality (70-84%)

- Moderate buying signals
- Verified contact details
- Property details confirmed
- System size estimate reasonable
- Recent inquiry (within 7 days)

**Expected conversion rate:** 20-35%  
**Average price:** $55-$74

### Standard Quality (60-69%)

- Basic buying signals
- Contact details verified
- Property information available
- Inquiry within 14 days

**Expected conversion rate:** 10-25%  
**Average price:** $45-$54

**Pro tip:** Start with high-quality leads to build confidence in the platform. As you get comfortable, you can experiment with lower-priced leads to maximize volume.

## Pricing & Payment

### How Pricing Works

- **No subscriptions** - Pay only for leads you purchase
- **No monthly fees** - No ongoing costs
- **No contracts** - Cancel anytime (nothing to cancel)
- **Per-lead pricing** - $45-$95 based on quality score

### Payment Methods

- Credit card (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
- Debit card
- Charged instantly when you purchase a lead

### Refund Policy

We stand behind our lead quality. If a lead meets any of these criteria, contact us for a full refund:

- Phone number is disconnected or invalid
- Email bounces (invalid address)
- Person denies requesting solar information
- Lead was sold to you by mistake (duplicate, wrong service area, etc.)

**How to request a refund:**

1. Go to "My Leads" in your dashboard
2. Click the lead you want to refund
3. Click "Request Refund" and provide a reason
4. We'll review and process within 24 hours

**Important:** Refunds are not available for leads where the homeowner simply chose another installer or changed their mind. That's normal sales friction, not a lead quality issue.

## Maximizing Your ROI

### Best Practices from Top-Performing Installers

**1. Speed is everything**

The fastest installers win. Our data shows:

- Contact within 1 hour: 45% conversion rate
- Contact within 4 hours: 28% conversion rate
- Contact within 24 hours: 15% conversion rate
- Contact after 24 hours: 8% conversion rate

**Action:** Set up lead notifications (email + SMS) so you're alerted instantly when you purchase a lead.

**2. Buy leads during business hours**

Leads purchased Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM have 2x higher conversion rates than leads purchased outside business hours.

**Why:** You can call immediately while the homeowner is available.

**Action:** Check the marketplace multiple times per day during business hours. New leads are added every 4 hours.

**3. Focus on your service area**

Installers who stick to their core service area (within 30km of their office) have 35% higher conversion rates.

**Why:** You can offer faster site visits, lower travel costs, and better local knowledge.

**Action:** Set your service postcodes accurately in your profile. Don't chase leads outside your area just because they're available.

**4. Track your numbers**

Top performers track these metrics weekly:

- Leads purchased
- Leads contacted
- Quotes sent
- Deals won
- Conversion rate (deals won ÷ leads purchased)
- Average deal value
- ROI (revenue ÷ lead cost)

**Action:** Use the "My Leads" dashboard to update lead status after every interaction. Review your metrics weekly and adjust your strategy.

**5. Test different quality tiers**

Don't assume high-quality leads are always the best ROI. Some installers find better margins with medium-quality leads because:

- Lower cost per lead ($55-$74 vs $75-$95)
- Less competition (other installers chase high-quality leads)
- Volume opportunity (more available)

**Action:** Buy 5 high-quality leads, 5 medium-quality leads, and 5 standard-quality leads. Track conversion rates and ROI for each tier. Double down on what works for your business.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How fresh are the leads?

All leads are generated within 14 days of being listed. The "Time Listed" on each lead card shows exactly when it was added to the marketplace. Most leads sell within 4 hours of being listed.

### Are leads exclusive?

Yes. Once you purchase a lead, it's removed from the marketplace and no other installer can buy it. You're the only one with those contact details.

### What if the homeowner doesn't answer?

Try multiple contact methods (phone, email, SMS if available) at different times of day. Our data shows the best times to reach homeowners are:

- Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM - 12 PM
- Tuesday-Thursday, 6 PM - 8 PM
- Saturday, 9 AM - 11 AM

If you can't reach them after 5 attempts over 3 days, contact support for a refund.

### Can I see leads before I sign up?

Yes! Browse the marketplace without signing up: [https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/dashboard](https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/dashboard)

You'll see lead cards with quality scores, locations, system sizes, and prices. You just won't see contact details until you purchase.

### How many leads should I buy per week?

It depends on your capacity. Here's a rough guide:

- **Solo installer:** 5-10 leads per week
- **Small team (2-5 people):** 10-20 leads per week
- **Medium team (6-15 people):** 20-50 leads per week
- **Large team (16+ people):** 50+ leads per week

Start small, track your conversion rate, and scale up as you get comfortable.

### What if I'm not happy with the leads?

Contact us within 7 days of joining and we'll refund any leads that didn't meet your expectations. We want you to succeed, and we'll work with you to find the right lead types for your business.
