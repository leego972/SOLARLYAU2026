## Follow-Up Messages (After Connection Accepted)

### Message 1: Introduction & Value Proposition

**Subject:** SolarlyAU - Your First Solar Lead Free

Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! I wanted to reach out because we've just launched **SolarlyAU**, and I think it could be a game-changer for how [Company] gets solar leads.

**The problem we're solving:** Most lead gen companies charge you upfront for leads you haven't seen, share them with multiple competitors, or lock you into expensive monthly subscriptions. We've flipped that model entirely.

**How SolarlyAU works:** Our AI system finds real Australian homeowners interested in solar, verifies their contact details (phone and email), scores their quality (60-95%), and lists them in a marketplace. You log in, browse leads in your service area, see full details (name, phone, email, address, system size, monthly bill, quality score), and only pay for the leads you actually want.

**Pricing:** $45-$95 per lead based on quality score. No monthly fees, no contracts, no minimums. And right now, your first lead is completely free.

**Current marketplace:** 654 leads available across NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, and SA. New leads added every 4 hours. Average lead sells within 4 hours because installers love the transparency.

**Want to take a look?** You can browse the marketplace without signing up: [https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/dashboard](https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/dashboard)

If you like what you see, signing up takes 2 minutes: [https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup](https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup)

Let me know if you have any questions!

Cheers,

### Message 2: Follow-Up (If No Response After 3 Days)

**Subject:** Re: SolarlyAU - Still interested?

Hi [Name],

I sent you a message a few days ago about SolarlyAU's lead marketplace. I wanted to follow up because we still have the first-lead-free offer available, and there are currently [X] leads in [State] that match [Company]'s service area.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short: **Would you be interested in claiming your free lead?** It's a zero-risk way to test our platform and see if the lead quality meets your standards.

If yes, here's the signup link: [https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup](https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup)

### Message 3: Final Follow-Up (If No Response After 7 Days)

**Subject:** Last call - Free solar lead for [Company]

Hi [Name],

This is my last message about SolarlyAU. I don't want to be pushy, but I also don't want you to miss out on a free lead.

**Quick recap:** We're a solar lead marketplace where you browse verified leads, see full details before buying, and only pay for what you want. First lead is free for new installers.

**If you're interested:** Sign up here → [https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup](https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup)

**If you're not interested:** No problem - I'll leave you alone. Just reply "not interested" and I won't message again.

Either way, best of luck with [Company]!

### InMail Version 2: Pain Point Focus

**Subject:** Tired of Paying for Bad Solar Leads?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much did [Company] spend on lead gen last month? And how many of those leads actually converted?

Most solar installers I talk to are frustrated with traditional lead gen companies. They pay upfront for leads they haven't seen, get shared leads that go to 5+ competitors, or waste money on monthly subscriptions that don't deliver.

That's why we built **SolarlyAU** - a marketplace that flips the model:

**You're in control:** Browse leads in your area, see full details (name, phone, email, address, system size, quality score), and only pay for the ones you want.

**Transparent pricing:** $45-$95 per lead based on quality. No hidden fees, no subscriptions, no contracts.

**Quality guaranteed:** Every lead is phone verified, email verified, and scored by our AI (60-95% quality scores).

**Right now:** 654 leads available across Australia. Your first lead is free.

**Take a look:** [https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/dashboard](https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/dashboard) (no signup required)

**Sign up:** [https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup](https://solar-lead-vwkzbmwb.manus.space/installer/signup) (2 minutes)

## LinkedIn Profile Optimization (For Your Profile)

**Headline:**
```
Founder at SolarlyAU | Helping Australian Solar Installers Get High-Quality Leads Without Subscriptions
```

**About section:**
```
I'm building SolarlyAU - Australia's first solar lead marketplace where installers browse verified leads, see full details before buying, and only pay for the leads they actually want.

After talking to dozens of solar installers frustrated with traditional lead gen companies (expensive subscriptions, shared leads, poor quality), I realized there had to be a better way.

So we built a marketplace powered by AI that finds real Australian homeowners interested in solar, verifies their contact details, scores their quality, and lets installers choose which leads to purchase.

No subscriptions. No contracts. No shared leads. Just transparent, pay-per-lead pricing ($45-$95 based on quality).

Current marketplace: 654 verified leads across NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA. New leads added every 4 hours.
